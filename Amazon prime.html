  <p>Prime Video, also known Amazon Prime Video, is a subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming and rental service of Amazon.com, Inc., offered as a standalone service or as part of Amazon's Prime subscription. The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by Amazon Studios or licensed to Amazon, as Amazon Originals, with the service also hosting content from other providers, content add-ons, live sporting events, and video rental and purchasing services.

Prime Video additionally offers a content add-on service in the form of channels, called Amazon Channels, or Prime Video Channels, which allow users to subscribe to additional video subscription services from other content providers within Prime Video, such as Epix, Starz, Pantaya, Discovery+, Boomerang, Cinemax, Tastemade, Curiosity Stream, Ameba TV, StackTV, Showtime, BET+, Paramount+, Noggin, BBC Select, BritBox, AMC+, Allblk, Shudder, and Acorn TV.
